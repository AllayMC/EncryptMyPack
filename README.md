### Encryption

Command: `EncryptMyPack.exe encrypt <inputZip> <outputZip> [key]`

1. The key should be a 32 character long string. If you don't provide a key, the key will be `liulihaocai123456789123456789123`

2. Make sure your pack is a zip file, and in your pack should be a manifest.json

After the encryption, a `contents.json` should now be in output zip file, and the key will be displayed in the console

2. To decrypt the pack, you must provide its key
