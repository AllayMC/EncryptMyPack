A command line util for encrypting and decrypting resource packs.

## Usage

Before use this tool, make sure you have java 21 runtime!

### Encryption

Command: `java -jar EncryptMyPack.jar encrypt <inputFolder> <outputFolder> [key]`

1. The key should be a 32 character long string. If you don't provide a key, the key will be `liulihaocai123456789123456789123`

2. Make sure your pack is unzipped, and in your pack directory should be a manifest.json

After the encryption, a `contents.json` should now be in your pack/output directory, and the key will be displayed in the console

### Decryption

Command: `java -jar EncryptMyPack.jar decrypt <inputFolder> <outputFolder> <key>`

1. Again, the key should be a 32 character long string.
2. To decrypt the pack, you must provide its key
